//*Decoding*//

decoding -- the process of generating text with an LLM

e.g

I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. they sent me a___________.

words Probability....... lion 0.03, elephant 0.02, dog 0.45, cat 0.4


//// Decoding happens iteratively, 1 word at a time 
//// at each step decoding we use the distribution over vocabulary and select 1 word to emit
//// the word is appended to the input the decoding process continues 


//*Greedy Decoding *//
then picking the highest probability word at each step
so it will generate like this 

i wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. they sent me a dog_____

after selecting the dog then the probability for other words change

word probability....... EOS 0.99, elephant0.0001, panther 0.0005....

----> then it will select the EOS .....END OF SENTENCE 

=======the final output=========
output: i wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. they sent me a dog.


{this was the process of Greedy Decoding}
