//*LLM Application*//

//*Retrieval Augmented Generation*//

this is primarily used in QA, where the model has access to (retrieval) support document
for a query 
//--> in the simple words Search first, then answer the questions

// a language model like chat gpt only knows what it was trained on if i ask about the policy of company 
or anything like this is will not know the right answer 
// so to fix this RAG first looks up relevant doc then answer related to this 


claimed to reduce hallucination


//---> Non-parametric: it means for improvements for this model is easy you don't have to change 
the code of the model for the improvements you should just add more docs for improve answer 

//* Code Model*//
these model are trained on code and comments 
these are like co-pilot, Codex,  Code Llama
