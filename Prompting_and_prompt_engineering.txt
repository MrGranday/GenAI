//* Prompting and prompt engineering*//

an LLM compute a distribution over the next word in the sequence which i will be illustrating with the probabilities under the visualized words 

I WROTE TO THE ZOO TO SEND ME A PET. THEY SENT ME A..............

words Probability (example)
line ....0.1
elephant....0.1
dog.....0.3
cat.... 0.2
panther...0.05


to exert some control over the LLM we can affect the probability over vocabulary in 2 ways 
// Prompting
// Training

//* Prompting   *//

the simplest way to affect the distribution over the vocabulary is to change the prompt
=> the text provided to an LLM  as input sometimes containing instructions and/or example
 
 the example that we have talked about above 
 ........ they sent me a little .......

 so in here the probability of the smaller animals goes up and the probability of the larger animals goes down



//* Prompt engineering*//

 the process of iteratively refining a prompt for the purpose of eliciting a particular style of response 
 in the prompt engineering you would br actually generating text form a model and seeing wither the generated text looks good
